When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
-collaborating with others
-backing up your work so you don't have to worry about losing it if you lose your computer
-working on multiple computers

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
-pushing automatically might cause too many changes in github
-you might not be ready to share a feature yet

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
-fork: want to copy someones repository within github
-clones: want to copy a repository and have it on your local computer
-branches: adding new info within one repository (no copying)

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
-keeps track of where your remote was when you last pulled from git
