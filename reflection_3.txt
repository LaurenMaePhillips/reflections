When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
-collaborating with others
-backing up your work so you don't have to worry about losing it if you lose your computer
-working on multiple computers

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
-pushing automatically might cause too many changes in github
-you might not be ready to share a feature yet
